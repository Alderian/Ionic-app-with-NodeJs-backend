fullstack
=========

N.B This project is very much a progress and I haven't decided where it is going.
I couldn't find any projects with backends for Ionic apps so I decided an app with one.

Things are still pretty messy I.E. files are still included which shouldn't be,
but I thought there's no harm in putting it out there!

[Ionic] (https://github.com/driftyco/ionic) app with NodeJs Express based on a
backend generated by [Angular fullstack generator] (https://github.com/DaftMonk/fullstack-demo)

This project uses MongoDB, so having a database listening on Localhost should be fine.

The backend hasn't changed much from one genertated by the fullstack generator, so please
do see that project for setting environment variables (such as Facebook client IDs), databases etc.

## Quick Start

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hardgreaves/fullstack
$ cd fullstack
$ npm install & bower install
$ cordova plugin add org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser
$ gulp build
$ node server/app.js
```
To build/run the project as a native app run from within the client
folder. Note that when built as a native app you should chance *apiUrl*
in the config service to the url of your api server.

```bash
  ionic run [Platform]
```

## Notes
This project uses [gulp] (https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/) along with bower
to inject dependencies into www/index.html using the command 'gulp build'.
Run gulp sass from within the client folder to generate CSS from the ionic.app.scss
file in SCSS
